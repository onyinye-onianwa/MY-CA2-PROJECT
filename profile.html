                <p>This page tells you about my skills, the ones i think i have and the ones i have been told about.</p>
                <p>Firstly apparently! I'M CREATIVE, i dont know what i created... oh wait i created this webisteü§£ okay i am creative or talented however you want to put it.</p>
                <p>I have good LEADERSHIP SKILLS. This i actually know and i have been told, even won an awardüèÜ for it in junior secondary.</p>
                <p>In the sense of communication i have a decent SOCIAL SKILL. My friends are limited dont get me wrongü§£ but i communicate good for sure.</p>
                <p>I want to believe i speak well when it comes to being serious, but around friends sometimes i do say gibberish and to be honest i think its normal. All in all I SPEAK well and proper when needed.</p>
                <p>I am PATIENT with everyone. we all know thats a skill lets not lie. even if you piss me off i would still be patient but it gets to an extent o!! i dont like see finish. half the time i wont say anything cause i choose PEACE OVER ANYTHING. I also hate beign direspected it awakens something inside me, a sense of evilüò≠. I'M JUST A GIRLüòä.</p>
